        <p>The social divisions in Maycomb are similar but differ from real live segregation because in Maycomb, there is a hierarchy that goes from Rich White People > Middle Class White People > Poor/Terrible White People > Black People. They're similar because Jim Crow Laws appear throughout the story in many ways.</p>
