        <li>
          One example, is Tom Robinson, a black man falsely accused of sextually assulting a white woman named Mayella Ewell.
        </li> <br>
        <li>
          Another example is that they enforced segregation on public transportation, requiring Black passengers to use separate facilities, sit in the back of buses and trains, and endure inferior conditions.
        </li> <br>
        <li>
          They also created a system of legal racial segregation where schools for Black and white students were separate, but the schools for Black students were chronically underfunded, had fewer resources, and worse facilities.
        </li> <br>
        <li>
          There were also laws that created systemic inequality and limiting opportunity for African Americans for decades after slavery.
        </li> <br>
        <li>
          White men felt more superior than black men.
        </li> <br>
        <li>
          A white man's word was accepted more than that of a black man's.
        </li> <br>
        <li>
          African American churches were just as likely to uphold the Jim Crow laws as white churches.
        </li> <br>
        <li>
          Whites saw themselves as rich and blacks as poor.
        </li> <br>
        <li>
          The community in the book also thought that any type of relationship between both races was wrong.
        </li> <br>
        <li>
          They separated both races and caused each race to have their own buildings and areas.
        </li>
      </ul>
